You talk
Close to me
I know your ways
I can feel your dreams
And you talk close me
Fairy domes and princesses
Living in illusion
A touch me free

I need you nite life
Close to me
I need your nite life
Fantasy

When the dance night flies
And the broadway screams

Connect up with me
I feel your heartbeat
A pounding soft
Oh i, i'm taking off

You stick close to me
The right intrusion
Is what we need
Oh the touch is free

I need you nite life
Close to me
I need your nite life
Fantasy

When the dance night flies
And the broadway screams
When the dance night flies
And the broadway screams
Watching your slick trick
Still life moving
Oh ever so softly
Your letting it show
Still by windows
Some are running
Thinking they dreamt you
But never to know

Connect up to me
I need your nite life, ya

Connect up to me
I need your nite life, Mmmm

Connect up to me
I need your nite life yeah

Connect up to me
Oh i need your nite life yeah
Connect up to me
Connect up to me
Connect... up to me
You talk close to me
But i know your ways
Feel your dreams, yeah

And you talk close to me
Fairy domes and princesses
Living in illusion

Oh touch me free

Connect up to me
Feel your heartbeat
Walking in the city streets
Feel the nightlife

Put on your city beat
And walk the nightlife, yeah
And walkin

And move to the city beat
Oh on the nightlife
