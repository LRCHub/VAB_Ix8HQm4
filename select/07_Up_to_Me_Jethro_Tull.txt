Take you to the cinema
And leave you in a Wimpy Bar
You tell me that we've gone too far
Come running up to me
Make the scene at Cousin Jack's
Leave him to put the bottles back
Mends his glasses that I cracked
Well that's one up to me, yeah

Ohhh, it's up to me, yeah

Buy a silver cloud to ride
Pack a tennis club inside
Trouser cuffs hung far too wide
Well it was up to me
Tire's down on your bicycle
Your nose feels like an icicle
The yellow fingered smoky girl
Is looking up to me, yeah

Ohhh, it's all up to me

Well I'm a common working man
With a half of bitter, bread and jam
And if it pleases me I'll put one on you man
When the copper fades away

Ohhh, it's up to me
Ohhh, it's all up to me

The rainy season comes to pass
The day-glo pirate sinks at last
And if I laughed a bit too fast
Well it was up to me
Take you to the cinema
And leave you in a Wimpy Bar
You tell me that we've gone too far
Come running up to me, yeah
